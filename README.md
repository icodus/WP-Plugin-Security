# WP Plugin Security Checklist 

When developing a WordPress plugin, it's essential to consider several security hazards to avoid vulnerabilities. Here are some common security risks and best practices to mitigate them:

### 1. **SQL Injection**
   - **Hazard**: Directly inserting user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping can allow malicious users to inject their own SQL commands.
   - **Prevention**: Always use `prepare()` for database queries. Sanitize and validate input data before passing it to SQL statements.

   ```php
   $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}table WHERE id = %d", $id );
   ```

### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Hazard**: Allowing user input to be outputted on the site without proper escaping can lead to attackers injecting malicious scripts.
   - **Prevention**: Escape output using functions like `esc_html()`, `esc_url()`, `esc_attr()`, and `wp_kses()` to prevent script injections.

   ```php
   echo esc_html( $user_input );
   ```

### 3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - **Hazard**: CSRF attacks trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions, such as changing settings or submitting forms.
   - **Prevention**: Use nonce functions (`wp_nonce_field()` and `check_admin_referer()`) to verify the request's authenticity and that it is from a trusted user.
   
   ```php
   if ( ! isset( $_POST['your_nonce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['your_nonce'], 'your_action' ) ) {
       die( 'Security check failed' );
   }
   ```

### 4. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
   - **Hazard**: Allowing users to upload files without proper checks can lead to execution of malicious files (e.g., PHP files).
   - **Prevention**: Limit file types, validate file extensions and MIME types, and store uploaded files outside of the web root if possible. Use WordPress functions like `wp_handle_upload()`.

   ```php
   $uploadedfile = $_FILES['file'];
   $upload_overrides = array( 'test_form' => false );
   $movefile = wp_handle_upload( $uploadedfile, $upload_overrides );
   ```

### 5. **Privilege Escalation**
   - **Hazard**: Mismanagement of user roles and capabilities can allow users to perform actions they shouldnâ€™t be allowed to.
   - **Prevention**: Define user roles properly and restrict access to sensitive actions using capabilities. Check user permissions with `current_user_can()`.

   ```php
   if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
       wp_die( 'You do not have permission to access this page.' );
   }
   ```

### 6. **Insecure API Exposure**
   - **Hazard**: Exposing sensitive data or functionality through poorly protected API endpoints can lead to data leaks or unauthorized actions.
   - **Prevention**: Authenticate API requests using nonces or OAuth, and sanitize/validate API inputs and outputs.

### 7. **Path Traversal**
   - **Hazard**: Malicious actors can manipulate file paths to access or modify restricted files.
   - **Prevention**: Use `realpath()` to resolve file paths, and ensure that user input is sanitized before using it in file paths.

### 8. **Insecure Deserialization**
   - **Hazard**: Untrusted data, when deserialized, can lead to object injection and code execution.
   - **Prevention**: Avoid unserializing data from untrusted sources. Use JSON format instead where possible. If deserialization is necessary, ensure input validation and sanitation.

### 9. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
   - **Hazard**: Allowing arbitrary code to be executed on the server.
   - **Prevention**: Never execute user inputs or unsanitized data. Avoid using functions like `eval()` or `exec()` with user-supplied content.

### 10. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Hazard**: Revealing sensitive information like file paths, WordPress version, or other system details can aid attackers.
   - **Prevention**: Disable error reporting in production and avoid exposing sensitive data in HTML comments or API responses.

### General Security Best Practices:
   - **Keep everything updated**: Regularly update your WordPress core, themes, and plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - **Use WordPress security APIs**: Leverage WordPress security mechanisms, such as the `Settings API`, `User Roles API`, and `Transients API`, for secure plugin development.
   - **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communications between the plugin and the server are encrypted.

By addressing these hazards, you can significantly enhance the security of your WordPress plugin and protect it from common threats.
